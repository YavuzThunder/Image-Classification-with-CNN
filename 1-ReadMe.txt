To run the project:

Open the relevant directory with an IDE that has Python 3.10 interpreter, and update the libraries.
The project was developed in PyCharm, and we recommend using PyCharm to avoid any secondary errors.
The test images are included in the directory with a specific arrangement; the images and main.py should be in the same directory.
Run the script by adding the name of the image file (e.g., 'j9_truck.jpg') into the method on line 51.
The script's execution time may vary depending on your system resources, so please wait.
There is no need to remove the comment blocks.
